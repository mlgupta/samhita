      <li> Groups are composed of users that are related in some way. For example, the Marketing group might contain all of the members of the corporate marketing organization. </li>
    </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> Groups simplify user management. Instead of adding each user to an ACL for a file or folder, you can add a group of users all at the same time. Samhita product is shipped with WORLD, a default group. When users are created, they are automatically added to this group. To create a group, you define the group itself, then populate it. Group names are unique within the owner's set of groups. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> The default ACL of the user that created this group is assigned to any new group the user creates. If you need to change the default ACL, you can do so by modifying the ACL for a specific group </li>
