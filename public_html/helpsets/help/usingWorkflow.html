        1) First create an ACL for the list of approvers:
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a permission bundle named "approver" with GetContent and
                  Discover permissions.Create an ACL with list of users which will act
                  as approvers in the same hierarchy as the organizational structure
                  with grant on "approver" permission bundle(if there is only one
                  approver then only one entry will be there in this acl).The last
                  person/user in this ACL is the highest in the hierarchy.This
                  particular ACL's name should start with "wf".
      </ul>
    </td></tr>
    <tr><td><div align="center"><img src="images/workflow_acl.gif"></div></td></tr>
  <tr><br><br><br></tr>    
     <tr><td align="left">
      <ul>
      2) Edit the user who will act as requestor and select the workflow ACL for
         him.Save the settings.
        <br>
      </ul>
      </td></tr>
  <tr><td><div align="center"><img src="images/user_edit.gif"></div></td></tr>
  <tr><br><br><br></tr>
      <tr><td>
      <ul>
      3) Now the user is workflow enabled and he can submit docs for approval.      
        <br>
      </ul>
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td>
      <ul>
      4) Go to the document page with requestor logged in and select one
         document and click on "Submit to workflow icon"[ <img src="images/icons/butt_workflow_submit.gif" width="30" height="24" align="absmiddle"> ] or select from menu File-&gt;Submit To Workflow.      
        <br>
      </ul>
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td>
      <ul>
      5) Now the requestor can go to his notifications page and view the document status and movement.He shall also get the final result as notification ie(approved or rejected).
         All the notifications for the requestor will be of type FYI.
        <br>
      </ul>

    <tr><br><br><br></tr>
      <tr><td>
      <ul>
      6) Meanwhile the first person in the list of approvers gets the notification on which he can respond by clicking approve or reject
         button.

  <tr><br><br><br></tr>
      <tr><td>
      <ul>  
      7) If it is approved the requisition goes to the next approver and the cycle continues until the document is either rejected by anyone of them or
         it is approved by all of them, after which the doc is considered approved.
