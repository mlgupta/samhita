        <li>Samhita workflow has been modelled in such a way that it can accomodate both
            types of workflow ie<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Where only one approver is present.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Where a list of approvers are present according to a hierarchy <br>
            
            <br>
            
            When a list of approvers are present according to a hierarchy,the
            workflow process takes the approval requisition from one approver to his
            immediate senior(if the previous approver approves it) else rejection by
            any approver leads to the rejection of the requisition and the requestor
            is notified.<br><br>
            
            The last person in this hierarchy is the final approver.If he
            decides to approve the document, the document is finally approved and a
            notification is sent to the requestor.<br><br>
            
            The requestor also gets the notification regarding the movement of document along the hierarchy.<br>
